## Code Style Guidelines

- Use typescript
- Use strict mode with proper types for all variables, functions, and components
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code.
- Use const for constants and let for variables that will be reassigned.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays.
- Use template literals for strings that contain variables.
- Use the latest JavaScript features (ES6+) where possible.
- React functional components with hooks, proper typing for props
- Formatting: Tabs (width: 2), max line width: 80, double quotes for strings/JSX
- Imports Group imports by external, internal, types. Use path alias `~/*` for imports from src
- Error Handling: Use React Error Boundary for UI errors, proper API error handling with feedback
- Naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions, ALL_CAPS for constants
- Testing: Component tests with React Testing Library, unit tests with Vitest
